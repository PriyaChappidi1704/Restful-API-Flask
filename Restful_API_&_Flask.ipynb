        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "  - A RESTful API is an interface that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data.\n",
        "It follows REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural principles.\n",
        "It supports operations like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for resource handling.\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        "  - An API specification defines how APIs should behave and what endpoints are available.\n",
        "It includes details like request types, parameters, responses, and error codes.\n",
        "Popular formats include OpenAPI and Swagger for documenting APIs.\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "  - Flask is a lightweight Python web framework for building web applications and APIs.\n",
        "It is popular due to its simplicity, flexibility, and minimal boilerplate code.\n",
        "Flask supports extensions, routing, and RESTful API creation with ease.\n",
        "4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "  - Routing in Flask maps URLs to specific functions in your code.\n",
        "Each route is associated with a function that executes when the route is accessed.\n",
        "It helps organize and control how users interact with the web application.\n",
        "5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "  - Import Flask from the flask module and create an app instance.\n",
        "Define a route using @app.route() and link it to a function.\n",
        "Run the application using app.run() to start the development server.\n",
        "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "  - Common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.\n",
        "GET retrieves data, POST creates, PUT updates, and DELETE removes resources.\n",
        "They define the type of action the client wants to perform on the server.\n",
        "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "  - The @app.route() decorator is used to define URL routes in Flask.\n",
        "It links a URL to a specific Python function that handles the request.\n",
        "This allows users to access different pages or functionalities in the app.\n",
        "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "  - GET is used to retrieve data from the server and does not change the state.\n",
        "POST is used to send data to the server, often to create new resources.\n",
        "GET appends data in the URL, while POST sends it in the request body.\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "  - Use @app.errorhandler() to define custom error responses.\n",
        "You can return JSON error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.\n",
        "Flask also supports default error handling for common errors like 404 or 500.\n",
        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "  - Use libraries like Flask-SQLAlchemy to integrate SQL databases.\n",
        "Configure the database URI in Flask's app.config.\n",
        "Initialize the database object and define models for tables.\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "  - Flask-SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) extension for Flask.\n",
        "It simplifies database operations by allowing Python classes to represent tables.\n",
        "It supports querying, relationships, and migrations with minimal code.\n",
        "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "  - Blueprints help organize a Flask application into reusable components or modules.\n",
        "Each blueprint can have its own routes, templates, and static files.\n",
        "They make large applications more manageable and modular.\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "  - The request object holds incoming request data like form fields, JSON, and headers.\n",
        "It is used to access user input, query parameters, and file uploads.\n",
        "It's essential for handling client-server communication in APIs.\n",
        "14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "  - Define a route using @app.route() and specify allowed HTTP methods.\n",
        "Write a function to handle the logic and return a response using jsonify().\n",
        "Use appropriate request handling (GET, POST, etc.) for different actions.\n",
        "15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "  - jsonify() converts Python dictionaries or lists into JSON format.\n",
        "It is used to send structured JSON responses to the client.\n",
        "It also sets the correct Content-Type header for JSON responses.\n",
        "16. Explain Flask's url_for() function?\n",
        "  - url_for() generates dynamic URLs for routes defined in Flask.\n",
        "It avoids hardcoding URLs and supports cleaner redirection.\n",
        "It is useful when linking between pages or handling redirects.\n",
        "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "  - Flask serves static files from the static/ directory by default.\n",
        "Use the url_for('static', filename='...') to link them in templates.\n",
        "This allows inclusion of CSS, JS, and image files in your web app.\n",
        "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "  - An API specification defines endpoints, request formats, and responses.\n",
        "It helps developers understand and use the API correctly.\n",
        "It improves consistency, collaboration, and documentation of the API.\n",
        "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "  - HTTP status codes indicate the result of a client's request.\n",
        "Examples include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Server Error).\n",
        "They help clients understand if the request was successful or failed.\n",
        "20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "  - Define a route with methods=['POST'] in @app.route().\n",
        "Access the data using request.form, request.json, or request.data.\n",
        "Process the data and return an appropriate response using jsonify().\n",
        "21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "  - Use authentication methods like API keys, JWTs, or OAuth.\n",
        "Validate input data to prevent injection and XSS attacks.\n",
        "Enable HTTPS, use secure headers, and limit access to sensitive routes.\n",
        "22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "  - Flask-RESTful simplifies building REST APIs with class-based views.\n",
        "It provides features like automatic routing, request parsing, and response formatting.\n",
        "It helps structure APIs in a clean and maintainable way.\n",
        "23. What is the role of Flask's session object?\n",
        "  - The session object stores user-specific data across requests.\n",
        "It is built on secure cookies and used for login states, preferences, etc.\n",
        "It allows persistence of information between user interactions."
